# Computer (Viz)ion

CViz is a small web application that animates common computer vision and image manipulation algorithms. This app is in very early stages and currently only implements a simple box and gaussian blur.

## Goals

I built this because I myself had a hard time understanding most computer vision algorithms. With math not being my strong suit, the simple task of convoluting two matrices was hard for me to grasp. This application hopes to ease this learning through visual explanations of what actually is happening.

## TODOs

- [ ] Add ability to interactively convolve 2 matrices/vectors
- [ ] Visualize differences of common smoothing filters (Box, Gaussian, and Pillbox)
- [ ] Show speed difference in separable filters
- [ ] Interactive template matching
- [ ] Interactive edge detection and corner detection
